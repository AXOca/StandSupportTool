# Stand Support Tool

> [!WARNING]  
> This repository is not intended for reporting issues related to Stand. For any Stand-related issues, please refer to the help resources available [here](https://stand.gg/help/).

Initial concept was made with Python on this project: [SST](https://github.com/AXOca/Stand-Tools/tree/main/SST)

Afterwards, [Alessandro](https://github.com/alessandromrc) made the initial polished version of my rough Python script in C#. They invited me to their repo, and I added a few features and optimized it. I also made the design (which is much easier in Visual Studio than what I did previously). Now, it's at least a tiny bit stand look-a-like like the website. That's it.

## To-Do List

- Improve the "Copy Log to Clipboard" feature by allowing users to select the number of instances of Stand to be copied (from one Welcome Message to the next).
- Add translation support for all languages already supported by Stand itself.
